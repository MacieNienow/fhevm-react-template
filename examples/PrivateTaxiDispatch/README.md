## üìñ Project Core Concepts

### FHE Contract Anonymous Taxi Dispatch

This system leverages **Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE)** to create a completely private taxi dispatch platform where:

- **Driver locations** are encrypted and never exposed publicly
- **Passenger pickup/destination coordinates** remain private throughout the process
- **Fare negotiations** happen through encrypted offers
- **Identity protection** for both drivers and passengers
- **Smart contract automation** handles matching and payments securely

### Privacy Taxi Management System

The platform provides a comprehensive privacy-first approach to ride-sharing:

#### For Drivers üöó
- Register anonymously on the blockchain
- Update encrypted location coordinates
- Set availability status privately
- Submit encrypted offers for ride requests
- Complete rides with encrypted passenger ratings

#### For Passengers üë§
- Request rides with encrypted pickup/destination data
- Set maximum fare preferences privately
- Review encrypted driver offers
- Rate drivers while maintaining anonymity
- Access complete ride history with privacy intact

#### For the System üîê
- All sensitive data encrypted using FHE
- Zero-knowledge proof implementations
- Decentralized matching algorithms
- Transparent yet private transaction records
- Anti-fraud mechanisms without compromising privacy
